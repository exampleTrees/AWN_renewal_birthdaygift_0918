          <p>Hi, Jim Rickards here.</p>
          
          <p>Gold is closer than ever to my predicted $10,000 per ounce.</p>
          
          <p>Which is exactly why I want you to celebrate my birthday with me today and get my highest level of access to my research and recommendations today.</p>
          
          <p>And to do that...</p>
          
          <p>I’m writing you a “$1,000 check” to put towards your financial future.</p>
          
          <p>Why?</p>
          
          <p>Because I want to reward loyal readers like you for looking outside the box to create a better life.</p>
          
          <p>Here’s the check I’ve assigned to you…</p>

          <img class="image_center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/agorafinancialwebsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jim_loyal_sub_check_mco.png" alt="Image of check from Jim Rickards to you" />

          <p>Here’s what happens when you cash this check today…</p>
          
          <p>You’ll <u>instantly</u> become a member of my inner circle.</p>
          
          <p>I’m talking about gaining the most elite access to all the best analysis I ever release.</p>

          <h3 class="red">I’ve Hand-Selected a Few  <br class="hidebr" />
            Loyal Readers Like YOU to <br class="hidebr" />
            Receive This Private Invitation. <br class="hidebr" />
            It’s for YOUR Eyes ONLY…</h3>

          <p>I’d like to send you EVERY research letter I ever publish FREE for LIFE.</p>
          
          <p>Because I’ve reviewed thousands of accounts, and you’re what we’re calling a “high value” customer.</p>
          
          <p>That’s why I’m offering you the chance to become a member of <strong><em>Rickards’ Unrestricted Clearance</em></strong> today.</p>
          
          <p>That means you’ll have VIP access to ALL of my most lucrative investment ideas for LIFE.</p>
          
          <p>I’m keeping this invite list <em>very</em> small — and I’m not releasing it to the general public. It’s just for you.</p>
          
          <p>Because members of <strong><em>Rickards’ Unrestricted Clearance</em></strong> can only make up less than 1% of our entire readership. We’re keeping this offer very exclusive. And considering we currently have 170,402 readers, that makes it <em>very</em> elite.</p>
          
          <p>Frankly, it’s not right for everyone. I’m sure some people will be turned off.</p>
          
          <p>I’m only looking for the most serious subscribers to be part of my inner circle — which is why I’m asking you not to share this invitation with anyone.</p>
          
          <p>I’m only inviting people who are serious about making a lot of money in a very short amount of time. I’m talking about enough money to sustain your family for generations to come.</p>
          
          <p>I hope that I’ve pegged you correctly and you’re as thrilled to receive this invitation as I am to send it to you.</p>

          <p>Of course, all of this accumulated experience presents a certain challenge.</p>
          
          <p>The challenge?</p>
          
          <p>Not all of the research fits into one neat and tidy bucket.</p>
          
          <p>That’s why <strong><em>Unrestricted Clearance</em></strong> now has FOUR UNIQUE research publications to present findings — along with stock recommendations.</p>

          <p>You’ll never run out of quality trading ideas, ever.</p>
          
          <p>For example, you’ll learn how to successfully trade cryptocurrencies with my <strong><em>Currency Wars Alert “Crypto Profits”</em></strong> upgrade. I launched a newsletter all about it…</p>

          <h3 class="blue"><em>Currency Wars Alert “Crypto Profits”</em>: <br>
            FREE Lifetime Access <br>
            (Value: $2,000 per Year)</h3>

          <p>It’s hard to ignore the recent cryptocurrency boom. However, it’s important to tread very lightly in this new and volatile market.</p>
          
          <p>In fact, I will never recommend hot cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Litecoin. Because I think 99% of cryptocurrencies out there are useless.</p>
          
          <p>That’s why I developed a system for tracking down the best opportunities that carry the least risk.</p>
          
          <p>So if you’ve been wondering how to get started trading cryptocurrencies, this is the answer.</p>
          
          <p>I won’t recommend anything that doesn’t pass my strict <strong>COINN</strong> criteria checklist…</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>C: Consensus</strong> &mdash; users can decide whom to trust organically and flexibly (like Google page ranks or wiki content) without being &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to trust miners (as with Bitcoin)</li>
            <li><strong>O: Open Source</strong> &mdash; this rules out government-controlled cryptos like &ldquo;FedCoin&rdquo; and &ldquo;IMFCoin&rdquo;</li>
            <li><strong>I: Impenetrable</strong> &mdash; this rules out coins that can be hijacked with fraudulent ledgers, gatekeeper attacks (like Ripple) and malevolent members using duplicates</li>
            <li><strong>N: No-Nonsense Governance</strong> &mdash; this rules out clunky, inefficient &ldquo;proof of work&rdquo; and &ldquo;proof of stake&rdquo; coins like Bitcoin and Ether</li>
            <li><strong>N: Nimble</strong> &mdash; this means fast, easy, cheap payments processing and rules out coins with long latency in validation like Bitcoin.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>And the best part is…</p>
          
          <p>My first recommendation is trading for just pennies right now. I predict that this tiny crypto could grow 10,000% in the next year. Much bigger than Bitcoin.</p>
          
          <p>And you could be one of the first to profit if you act fast.</p>

          <p>Reports won&rsquo;t show it yet. But I can guarantee Wall Street pundits have A LOT about hard assets wrong right now.</p>

          <h3 class="blue"><em>Jim Rickards’ Project Prophesy</em>:<br>
            FREE Lifetime Access<br>
            (Value: $2,000 per Year)</h3>

          <p>While working for the CIA, I developed a program to track &ldquo;terror&rdquo; trades. In fact, 9/11 could have been avoided if this technology had been in place at the time. Because American Airlines was set to tank weeks before the attacks &mdash; and that would&rsquo;ve been a red flag.</p>
          
          <p>After being buried in a CIA vault for 15 years, I&rsquo;ve redeveloped this amazing technology, with the help of IBM, to track social media networks and major media outlets.</p>

          <img class="image_center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/agorafinancialwebsite/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/RickardsIBM.png" alt="Jim and IBM Watson">

          <p>This is not simply a machine tracking buy and sell signals &mdash; it&rsquo;s actually artificial intelligence. The first of its kind to be used to make market decisions based on geopolitical events.</p>
          
          <p>Imagine being able to analyze 200 million Twitter posts all at once. That&rsquo;s what this computer system will be able to do. And I&rsquo;ve seen it work, firsthand. I&rsquo;ve used it.</p>
          
          <p>Here&rsquo;s what could happen&hellip;</p>
          
          <p>If certain global news and events lead us to believe the euro could soon rise, then I have the ability to tell you exactly what action to take ahead of time. This could put readers like you in a position to make a quick fortune.</p>
          
          <p>And once I finalize this system with IBM, we intend to sell it to huge wealth management firms for $5 million per year. But you&rsquo;re going to get access to it for FREE as a member of <strong><em>Rickards&rsquo; Unrestricted Clearance</em></strong>.</p>
          
          <p>And our first <strong><em>Project Prophesy</em></strong> trade on a rapidly growing gold mining company is already up 44%!</p>
          
          <p>As a member of <strong><em>Rickards&rsquo; Unrestricted Clearance</em></strong>, you&rsquo;ll receive this service FREE for LIFE.</p>
          
          <p>And that&rsquo;s not all&hellip;</p>
          
          <p>I would like to send you lifetime recommendations from my charter research letter.</p>
          
          <p>This is where it all began&hellip;</p>

            FREE Lifetime Access<br>
            (Value: $99 per Year)</h3>

          <p>Back in 2014, I launched my flagship research service, <strong><em>Strategic Intelligence</em></strong>.</p>
          
          <p>Today we have over 105,000 readers worldwide.</p>
          
          <p>You see, I&rsquo;ve spent the last 40 years advising top government officials&hellip;</p>
          
          <p>I worked with members of the Federal Reserve bank to save the U.S. from a $1.3 trillion banking crisis.</p>
          
          <p>I advised senior military leaders at the Pentagon and the highest ranks of the CIA to help them develop a financial model to predict the next 9/11.</p>
          
          <p>I warned the U.S. Treasury in a message about the housing collapse that ultimately wiped out many Americans.</p>
          
          <p>But I wanted to instead find a way to help everyday Americans.</p>
          
          <p>That&rsquo;s why I established <strong><em>Jim Rickards&rsquo; Strategic Intelligence</em></strong>. To help provide everyday Americans with insider access. Because by the time you&rsquo;re hearing about major market moves in media headlines, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
          
          <p>I want readers to not only be able to survive an imminent market collapse, but THRIVE. No matter what happens with our economy.</p>
          
          <p>Just listen to what some loyal readers have to say&hellip;</p>
